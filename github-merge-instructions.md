# GitHub Merge Instructions

## Current Situation
- You have a fork of the main repository
- You've made changes in Replit that you want to merge back
- GitHub web interface is showing "Something went wrong" errors

## Solution 1: Command Line Merge (Recommended)

### Step 1: Clone your fork locally
```bash
git clone https://github.com/glennajones/EPOCH-v83.git
cd EPOCH-v83
```

### Step 2: Add the upstream repository
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/[ORIGINAL-OWNER]/[ORIGINAL-REPO].git
git fetch upstream
```

### Step 3: Create a new branch for your changes
```bash
git checkout -b feature/replit-updates
```

### Step 4: Copy your updated files
Copy all files from the `github-export` directory (created by export-to-github.sh) into your local repository.

### Step 5: Commit and push your changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add EPOCH v8 ERP enhancements from Replit development

- Enhanced shipping management with automatic address population
- Improved waste management form with smart dropdowns
- Added comprehensive order tracking and QC workflows
- Integrated barcode system and employee portal
- Enhanced database schema and API endpoints"

git push origin feature/replit-updates
```

### Step 6: Create Pull Request
Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request from your `feature/replit-updates` branch to the main repository.

## Solution 2: Alternative Web Approach

If GitHub web interface still fails:

1. **Try GitHub Desktop**: Download GitHub Desktop app and sync your changes
2. **Contact GitHub Support**: If the error persists, it might be a GitHub platform issue
3. **Create a new repository**: Sometimes starting fresh resolves persistent issues

## Solution 3: Export as ZIP

If all else fails, you can:
1. Download the `github-export` folder as a ZIP
2. Upload it as a new repository
3. Invite the original repository owner as a collaborator

## Files Ready for Export
Your code is packaged in the `github-export` directory with:
- ✅ Complete source code (client, server, shared)
- ✅ Package configuration files
- ✅ Documentation and README
- ✅ Environment setup examples
- ✅ Mobile deployment configuration

## Next Steps
1. Choose your preferred solution above
2. Test the exported code locally before merging
3. Create a proper Pull Request with detailed description of changes
