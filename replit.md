## System Architecture

### Overall Architecture Pattern
The application follows a monorepo structure with a full-stack TypeScript approach:
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, built using Vite
- **Backend**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Shared**: Common TypeScript schemas and types
- **Mobile**: Capacitor for cross-platform deployment

### Key Architectural Decisions

**Problem**: Need for type safety across frontend and backend
**Solution**: Shared TypeScript schemas using Drizzle and Zod
**Rationale**: Eliminates type mismatches and provides compile-time validation

**Problem**: Complex form generation and data collection
**Solution**: Dynamic form builder with signature capture capabilities
**Rationale**: Allows non-technical users to create custom forms without development

**Problem**: Mobile and desktop deployment
**Solution**: PWA with Capacitor integration
**Rationale**: Single codebase for web and mobile platforms

## Key Components

### Frontend Components
- **Navigation System**: Wouter-based routing with dynamic navigation
- **Form Builder**: Drag-and-drop interface for creating custom forms
- **Data Tables**: Comprehensive CRUD operations for all entities
- **PWA Features**: Service worker, offline support, install prompts
- **UI Framework**: ShadCN UI components with Tailwind CSS

### Backend Services
- **API Routes**: RESTful endpoints for all data operations
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **File Storage**: CSV import/export functionality
- **External Integrations**: Address validation, PDF generation

### Database Schema
- **Core Tables**: Users, orders, customers, inventory
- **Feature System**: Dynamic product configuration
- **Forms System**: Custom form definitions and submissions
- **Employee Management**: Time tracking, onboarding, QC workflows
- **Enhanced Forms**: Advanced form builder with versioning
- **Inventory Management**: Restructured with AG Part#, Name, Source, Supplier Part#, Cost per, Order Date, Dept., Secondary Source, Notes fields with CSV import/export capabilities
- **P2 Product Receiving**: Specialized workflow for P2 products with Code 39 barcode generation, detailed tracking (manufacturing date, expiration date, batch number, lot number, aluminum heat number), and multi-label printing capability
- **OEM Production Orders**: Separate production order system for OEM customers generating stock orders from Purchase Orders, tracked independently from regular P1 orders with duplicate prevention and unified customer database integration
- **P1 Order Barcode System**: Comprehensive barcode generation and scanning system for all P1 orders with unique Code 39 barcodes (format: P1-{OrderID}), automated barcode generation for new orders, barcode scanner interface for viewing order pricing summaries with hidden pricing details for security, payment status tracking, line item breakdown without pricing visibility, and integrated barcode display/printing functionality in order management
- **Avery Label Printing**: Professional barcode label printing system for Avery 5160 labels (2.625" x 1") with exact 5-line format: (1) Action Length abbreviation + Stock Model (e.g., "SA CF Chalkbranch"), (2) Scannable Code 39 barcode image, (3) Paint subcategory only (e.g., "Carbon Black Camo"), (4) Customer Name, (5) Due Date. Action length extraction from features.action_length field with LA/MA/SA abbreviations. Labels optimized for high-quality printing with proper barcode resolution and spacing.

## Data Flow

### Order Management Flow
1. Customer creation/selection via search interface
2. Product configuration using dynamic features system with comprehensive state management
3. Feature consolidation: All form selections (features, railAccessory, otherOptions, paintOptions, bottomMetal, handedness) merged into unified features object
4. Order draft creation with automatic ID generation and complete feature persistence
5. Edit functionality: URL parameter-based loading (?draft=id) with full feature state restoration
6. Order processing through various status states
7. Inventory tracking and updates

### Form System Flow
1. Form definition creation via drag-and-drop builder
2. Form rendering with dynamic field types
3. Submission collection with validation
4. Report generation with filtering and export options

### Employee Workflow
1. Time clock entry with automatic status tracking
2. Task assignment and completion tracking
3. QC workflow execution with signature capture
4. Document management and onboarding
