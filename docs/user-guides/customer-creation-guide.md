# How to Create a New Customer - Step-by-Step Guide

## Overview
This guide walks you through creating a new customer in the EPOCH v8 Manufacturing ERP system. The process includes automatic address validation and smart data entry features to ensure accurate customer information.

## Prerequisites
- Access to the EPOCH v8 system
- Customer information (name, contact details, address)

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Navigate to Customer Management
1. From the main dashboard, click on **"Customer Management"** in the navigation menu
2. You'll see the Customer Management page with existing customers listed

### Step 2: Start Creating a New Customer
1. Look for the **"Add New Customer"** button (usually at the top of the customer list)
2. Click the button to open the customer creation form

### Step 3: Fill in Basic Customer Information
Complete the following required fields:

**Customer Details:**
- **Name**: Enter the customer's full name (required)
- **Email**: Enter customer's email address (optional but recommended)
- **Phone**: Enter customer's phone number (optional but recommended)
- **Company**: Enter company name if applicable (optional)
- **Customer Type**: Select from dropdown (usually "standard" for most customers)

### Step 4: Enter Customer Address with Smart Autocomplete
The system includes advanced address validation powered by SmartyStreets:

1. **Start typing the street address** in the address field
2. **Watch for suggestions** to appear as you type (e.g., "123 Main St")
3. **Select the correct address** from the dropdown suggestions
4. **Automatic field population**: The system will automatically fill in:
   - Street address
   - City
   - State
   - ZIP code (including +4 extension)

**Address Tips:**
- Type at least part of the street address to see suggestions
- Select from the dropdown rather than typing the full address manually
- The system validates addresses in real-time for accuracy
- ZIP codes are automatically looked up and formatted correctly

### Step 5: Review and Save
1. **Double-check all information** for accuracy
2. **Verify the address** is correctly formatted
3. Click **"Save"** or **"Create Customer"** to complete the process

### Step 6: Confirmation
- The system will show a success message
- The new customer will appear in the customer list
- The customer is now available for order creation and other processes

## Key Features

### Smart Address Autocomplete
- **Real-time suggestions**: As you type, the system shows matching addresses
- **ZIP code lookup**: Automatically finds and adds correct ZIP+4 codes
- **Address validation**: Ensures addresses are deliverable and properly formatted
- **Time-saving**: No need to manually enter city, state, and ZIP code

### Data Validation
- **Required field checking**: System prevents saving incomplete records
- **Email format validation**: Ensures email addresses are properly formatted
- **Phone number formatting**: Automatically formats phone numbers consistently

### Integration Benefits
- **Order entry ready**: New customers immediately available for order creation
- **Shipping integration**: Validated addresses work seamlessly with shipping systems
- **Consistent data**: All customer records maintain the same high-quality format

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Address autocomplete not showing suggestions
**Solution**: 
- Make sure you're typing enough of the address (at least street number and partial street name)
- Try typing "123 Main" instead of just "123"
- Verify internet connection is working

### Issue: ZIP code not filling in automatically
**Solution**:
- Select an address from the dropdown suggestions rather than typing manually
- The ZIP code lookup happens when you select a suggested address

### Issue: Form won't save
**Solutions**:
- Check that the customer name is filled in (required field)
- Ensure email format is correct if provided
- Verify all required fields are completed

### Issue: Duplicate customer creation
**Solution**:
- Use the search function to check if customer already exists
- Look for variations of the name (e.g., "John Smith" vs "J. Smith")

## Tips for Success

1. **Use the address autocomplete**: It's faster and more accurate than manual entry
2. **Include email and phone**: While optional, they're valuable for communication
3. **Check for duplicates**: Search existing customers before creating new ones
4. **Verify company names**: Use consistent naming for business customers
5. **Complete address information**: Full addresses prevent delivery issues later

## Next Steps
Once your customer is created:
- The customer will appear in the customer list
- You can create orders for this customer
- Edit customer information anytime from the Customer Management page
- Add additional addresses if needed for multiple locations
